# SIMPLE-BASH-TIMER
THIS IS BASH SCRIPT FOR A SIMPLE TIMER

# INSTALL
$ git clone https://github.com/WTS007/SIMPLE-BASH-TIMER.git
$ cd SIMPLE-BASH-TIMER/
$ chmod +x install.sh
$ ./install.sh

# USAGE
$ timer.sh
THE ABOVE COMMAND FROM YOUR PARENT DIRECTORY WILL START THE TIMER, WHERE YOU CAN SET THE HOURS FOR YOUR TIMER

# PROBLEMS
THE COMMAND "$ timer.sh" STOPS WORKING AS SOON AS CURRENT SESSION ENDS. 
THERE ARE FEW SOLUTIONS: 
1) ADDING "export PATH=$PATH:/your/folder/here" TO ~/.bashrc WILL DO THE TRICK
2) I WILL ADD A COPY OF "timer.sh" AND "2nd.sh" TO THE "~" DIRECTORY SO THE FOLLOWING COMMAND WILL ALWAYS WORK "$ ./timer.sh"

# MENTIONS
VISIT: https://www.putorius.net/how-to-make-countdown-timer-in-bash.html, THIS PERSON HAS A ARTICLE ABOUT MAKING A COULOURED VERSION OF TIMER (IF YOU ARE INTO THAT)

# FUTURE PLANS
I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT EXECUTABLE JUST AS A COMMAND WITHOUT REQUIRING ROOT PERMISSIONS.

THANKS
